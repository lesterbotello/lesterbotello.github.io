<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hey there, I'm Lester. I've been coding for most of my adult life, mostly around the .NET ecosystem. Writing software is one of many things I do, both for work and in my spare time. You may also often find me speaking about .NET and some other tech-related topics in different dev communities or conferences.

This is a place where I write about .NET and software development in general, but I might come up with a post about sci-fi (Star Wars, mostly, if you haven't guessed by now) or games from time to time.

Feel free to reach out through email / social media (my links are below) if you have any questions or comments.
