Well, that took a while. After an extended break from writing I intend to be back, hopefully for good. And boy, has the landscape in tech really changed during my absence. 

The digital inkwell ran dry. Not for a lack of stories, but because I was called away on other quests. For a time, this space along its collection of thoughts, lay dormant.

Life happened and in its own chaotic way it demanded our full attention. As the software development industry evolves and leans more towards AI-assisted development, effectively changing the way us developers approach the way we do our work, it's more important than ever to take the chance to build, learn, and grow. This is why writing, sharing, and connecting is more important now than ever.

In the light of this new reality we're called back to writing. The inkwell is full again. A lot of new interesting stories are now calling.

I'm looking at this not as a return but also as a renewal. I'm excited to share hard-won lessons hoping it will be of us to my fellow devs. We'll be diving deeper into .NET, Flutter and a little bit of everything in-between as well as exploring the practical applications of AI as a development tool.

The story continues. I'm glad to have you here as we turn the page.
